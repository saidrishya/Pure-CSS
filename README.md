# Pure-CSS

Tried to implement some basic/everyday things using CSS. The projects were created at the beginning of learning Web development. Hence, most of the html files have internal CSS. This won't be the case for the future projects

## 4. Newton's Craddle
Newton's cradle is a device that demonstrates conservation of momentum and energy using a series of swinging spheres. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes the last sphere upward. The last sphere swings back and strikes the still nearly stationary spheres, repeating the effect in the opposite direction.
